Hello testers!

Thanks for being part of the DarkRift beta!


There's a few things to know before your start:

1. There are a few minor bugs still known to be in DarkRift, please check out the bug board (see below) for the latest 
information and if you find any others please add them to the list. Also, expect there to be a lot of bugs!

2. There might need to be some breaking changes during the beta to fix bugs/poor design choices etc. so don't be surprised if you suddenly get syntax errors or if previous 
releases no longer work together with new releases. Hopefully these will be kept to a minimum but it's better to do them now rather than once it's fully released.

To get started have a look at the documentation available here:
http://www.darkriftnetworking.com/darkrift2/docs/index.html

There's also a community run discord open to all here:

Have fun!
